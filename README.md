GridImageSearch
===============

This is a Google Image Search app which allows a user to select search filters and paginate results


**_Time spent:_** A couple of hours here and there, ~ 16 hours spent in total. Got stuck on fragment view and wasted 4 hours, would have finished more features.

**_Completed user stories:_**

- [x] Required: User can enter a search query that will display a grid of image results from the Google Image API.
- [x] Required: User can click on "settings" which allows selection of advanced search options to filter results
- [x] Required: User can configure advanced search filters such as:
                Size (small, medium, large, extra-large)
                Color filter (black, blue, brown, gray, green, etc...)
                Type (faces, photo, clip art, line art)
                Site (espn.com)
- [x] Required: Subsequent searches will have any filters applied to the search results
- [x] Required: User can tap on any image in results to see the image full-screen

- [x] Optional: Use the ActionBar SearchView or custom layout as the query box instead of an EditText

**_Work-in-progress:_**
- [ ] Robust error handling, check if internet is available, handle error cases, network failures

- [ ] Improve the user interface and experiment with image assets and/or styling and coloring
- [ ] Use the StaggeredGridView to display improve the grid of image results
- [ ] User can zoom or pan images displayed in full-screen detail view

**_TODO:_**
